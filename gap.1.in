.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis
on Computational Group Theory.  GAP provides a programming language, a library
of thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects.  GAP is used in
research and teaching for studying groups and their representations, rings,
vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Boolean options (b, e, p, q, r, A, D, M, N, O, T, X, and Y) toggle the current
value each time they are used.  Default actions are indicated first.
.PP
MEM options indicate a number of bytes.  Larger units are indicated with
trailing characters: 'k' for kilobytes, m for megabytes, and g for gigabytes.
For example, '512k' means 512 kilobytes.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP \fIMEM\fP
Set the amount of preallocated space.
.TP
\fB\-b\fP
Disable/enable the banner.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIMEM\fP
Set the cache size.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP
Disable/enable quitting on Ctrl-D.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
Force line editing.
.TP
\fB\-g\fP
Show GASMAN messages.  If this option is given once, then full garbage
collections are shown.  If it is given twice, all garbage collections are
shown.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIFILE\fP
Load an alternate init file.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIPATHS\fP
Set the GAP root paths.  A leading semicolon means to append PATHS to the
existing list of root paths.  A trailing semicolon means to prepend PATHS.
Otherwise, the list of root paths is replaced with PATHS.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP \fIMEM\fP
Set the initial workspace size.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
Prevent line editing.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIMEM\fP
Set the hint for the maximal workspace size.  GAP may allocate more.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
Enable/disable emitting extra commands to the output to tell a window handler
what GAP is doing.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP
Enable/disable quiet mode.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP
Disable/enable reading of the .gaprc file.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP \fINUM\fP
Set the window width to NUM columns.
.TP
\fB\-y\fP \fINUM\fP
Set the window height to NUM rows.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP
Disable/enable autoloading of GAP packages.
.TP
\fB\-B\fP \fINAME\fP
Set the name of the current architecture.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP \fI<output>\fP \fI<input>\fP \fI<name>\fP
Compile an input file with the given name into an output file.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Enable/disable debugging the loading of library files.
.TP
\fB\-K\fP \fIMEM\fP
Set the maximal workspace size.  GAP never allocates more.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP \fIFILE\fP
Restore a saved workspace.
.TP
\fB\-M\fP
Disable/enable loading of compiled modules.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
Disable/enable check for completion files.
.TP
\fB\-O\fP
Enable/disable compatibility with GAP 3, by causing false and fail to be the
same value.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
Prevent restoring of workspace (causes -L to be ignored).
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
Disable/enable break loop.
.TP
\fB\-U\fP \fIOPTIONS\fP
Set the compile options for compiling GAP files.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP
Enable/disable CRC while reading completion.
.TP
\fB\-Y\fP
Enable/disable CRC while completing files.
